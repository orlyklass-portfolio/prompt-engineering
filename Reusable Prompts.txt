LLM Capability Matrix Generator Prompt
Master Prompt for Creating LLM Capability Matrices

If I was to do a research paper or an expose letter to an organization which would be better?

Research paper: GPT-4o all the way. No contest.
Exposé letter: Claude 4 Sonnet by a mile.

Here's why they're different beasts:

Research Paper = GPT-4o
Superior at systematic analysis - can handle complex multi-source synthesis
Better mathematical/statistical reasoning - if you need data analysis or citations
Stronger technical writing structure - follows academic conventions naturally
More comprehensive research assistance - better at literature reviews and methodology
Handles complex, multi-step logical arguments better
Exposé Letter = Claude 4 Sonnet
Exceptional at persuasive writing - knows how to build compelling narratives
Better ethical reasoning - stronger at identifying systemic problems and injustices
Superior tone control - can balance righteous anger with professional credibility
More nuanced understanding of power dynamics - crucial for organizational critique
Excellent at conflict resolution framing - knows how to present criticism constructively
The key difference: Research papers need systematic thoroughness. Exposé letters need strategic persuasion.

GPT-4o is like having the most methodical researcher on your team. Claude 4 Sonnet is like having the most articulate whistleblower advocate.

For an exposé specifically, you want someone who understands not just the facts, but how to present them in a way that compels action while maintaining credibility. That's Claude's sweet spot.
